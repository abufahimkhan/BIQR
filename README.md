The application was developed (Traffic assistant system) for vehicle paper management, and verification of the license, tax token, and registration card by generating a QR-Code., also the application comes with the police for scanning and validating data and the user administration. My teammates helped me to organize ideas and paper writing. The whole project is developed by myself. Find final thesis paper details: Capstone 400 C(BIQR) report.docx

This research paper presents the comprehensive development and implementation
of BIQR, an innovative mobile application designed to transform the landscape of
law enforcement document verification processes. The BIQR mobile app was
carefully developed to meet the urgent demand for increased security, efficiency,
and accuracy in law enforcement agencies. It does this by utilizing real-time
database integration and state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
technology.

The BIQR mobile app has developed into a powerful tool capable of automating the
verification of driver documents, car registrations, insurance papers, and other
documents via rigorous testing and iterative development. Hence minimizing
mistakes and significantly reducing the amount of human labor. An extensive
examination of the app&#39;s effects on law enforcement activities is included in this
report. Case studies from the real world and user comments demonstrate the useful
applications of BIQR, emphasizing how it may improve traffic safety, law
enforcement effectiveness, and compliance with regulations.

The report also addresses the difficulties encountered when developing the app,
including the tactics used to go above these barriers and improve the software.This
study paper offers insightful information about the transformative potential of
technology in the field of law enforcement, in addition to showcasing the technical
the expertise involved in producing the BIQR mobile app. This study adds crucial
knowledge of the subject of law enforcement technology by giving a thorough
explanation of the development process, difficulties encountered, and results
attained.


This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?
